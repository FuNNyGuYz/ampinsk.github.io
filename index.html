  <p>While I'm having an existential crisis about making a real site, here's a little about me. I'm currently working as a product designer at <a data-content="GitHub" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I've owned design on <a data-content="GitHub Desktop" href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>, <a data-content="GitHub Experiments" href="https://experiments.github.com">GitHub Experiments</a> and some other parts of the product. Before that, I worked at <a data-content="Upstatement" href="https://upstatement.com">Upstatement</a> and <a data-content="Ronik" href="https://ronikdesign.com">Ronik</a>, led the team at <a data-content="Scout Studio" href="https://neu.edu/scout">Scout Studio</a>, and graduated from Northeastern University.</p>

  <p>If you want to see some older work and side projects, you can read about an <a data-content="art museum visitor app" href="/project/museum">art museum visitor app</a> I researched and designed. I've also designed a <a data-content="typeface" href="/project/baudelaire">typeface</a> or two, and made a page to keep track of my <a data-content="reading" href="/reading">reading</a>. I'm notorious for being average at a thousand hobbiesâ€”most recently piano, Monday crossword puzzles, embroidery, and hand lettering.</p>

  <p>Say hey over <a data-content="email" href="mailto:apinsker4@gmail.com">email</a>, on <a data-content="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/ampinsk">Twitter</a>, or on <a data-content="LinkedIn" href="http://linkedin.com/in/amandapinsker">LinkedIn</a>. Or don't. That's perfectly okay too.</p>
