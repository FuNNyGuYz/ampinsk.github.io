  <h1>Amanda Pinsker</h1>
  <h2>Product & Interaction Designer</h2>
  <p>While I'm having an existential crisis about making a real site, here's a little about me. I'm currently working as a product designer at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I've worked on notifications, <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>, <a href="https://experiments.github.com">GitHub Experiments</a> and some other things. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://upstatement.com">Upstatment</a> and <a href="https://ronikdesign.com">Ronik</a>, led design at <a href="https://neu.edu/scout">Scout Studio</a>, and graduated from Northeastern University.</p>
  <p>If you want to see some older work and side projects, you can read about a <a href="/project/museum">museum visitor app</a> I researched and prototyped as part of my senior capstone. I've also designed a <a href="/project/baudelaire">typeface</a> or two, and made a page to keep track of my <a href="/reading">reading</a>. I'm notorious for being average at a thousand hobbiesâ€”most recently piano, Monday crossword puzzles, embroidery, and hand lettering.</p>
