      <section class="about">
        <p>I've been a product designer at <a>GitHub</a> for a few years now. I’ve spent most of my time there not working on the website. Right now, I’m working on a new command line tool.</p>
        <p>Before all this, I spent some time at <a>Upstatement</a> and <a>Ronik</a>, led the crew at <a>Scout</a>, and graduated from <a>Northeastern</a>.</p>
        <p>I grew up in the ‘burbs of New York<span class="footnote">6</span>, make a lot of self deprecating jokes<span class="footnote">7</span>, and I'm notorious for being average at a thousand hobbies—most recently piano, Monday crossword puzzles, embroidery, and hand lettering.<span class="footnote">3</span></p>
