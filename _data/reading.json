I'm forced me to grapple with the absurdity of what it feels like to move through the world as myself, and it resonates in a way that can only be felt. The way form and structure are twisted delights me over and over again. It makes me feel like I'm losing my mind in the best way. We live in an illogical world and trying to make sense of it is what makes us crazy.",
